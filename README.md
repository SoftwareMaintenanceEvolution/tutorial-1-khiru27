# Introduction
<h2> Hi! I'm Khiruba Sangkari a/p Malaravan, a student in the Software Maintenance and Evolution course. </h2>
I expect to learn a lot about modern software maintenance practices and how to work with legacy systems.

- **Fun fact**: I love playing badminton and I can ride the bike (I haven't gotten my B full license yet but am hoping to in the future, so its only B2 now).
- **Course expectations**: I expect to gain a lot of knowledge on Software Maintenance and Evolution as well as have fun doing so.
